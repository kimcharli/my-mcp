# Knowledge Extraction Strategies

This document outlines several methods for extracting and utilizing knowledge, ranging from basic techniques using current tools to more advanced, state-of-the-art approaches.

## Core Knowledge Extraction Techniques

These methods can be implemented directly using the available tools.

### 1. Local File Analysis

This technique involves searching and retrieving information from files within the project directory. It's ideal for understanding codebase conventions, finding specific implementations, or summarizing internal documentation.


- **Tools:** `search_file_content`, `glob`, `read_many_files`, `read_file`

- **Workflow:**

  1. Use `search_file_content` with a regular expression to find specific keywords or patterns.

  2. Alternatively, use `glob` to list files based on a pattern (e.g., `**/*.md`) and then `read_many_files` to ingest their content.

  3. Synthesize the retrieved information to answer a query or generate a summary.

### 2. Targeted Web Content Retrieval

When you have a specific URL for an article, documentation page, or other resource, you can fetch its content directly.


- **Tool:** `web_fetch`

- **Workflow:**

  1. Provide the URL(s) to the `web_fetch` tool.

  2. The tool retrieves the page content.

  3. The content can then be summarized, analyzed, or have specific information extracted from it.

### 3. General Web Research

For broader questions where the source is unknown, you can perform a web search to find relevant information first.


- **Tools:** `google_web_search`, `web_fetch`

- **Workflow:**

  1. Use `google_web_search` with a query to get a list of relevant web pages.

  2. Select the most promising URLs from the search results.

  3. Use `web_fetch` to retrieve the content from these URLs for analysis.

## Advanced Knowledge Extraction Strategies

These are more complex, state-of-the-art approaches that can provide enhanced capabilities for knowledge extraction and reasoning.

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is a powerful technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It grounds the model's responses in factual data, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy.


- **Concept:** Instead of relying solely on its internal knowledge, the model first retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base (e.g., a collection of project documents, a database, or web pages). It then uses this retrieved context to generate a more informed and accurate response.

- **Implementation:** This can be simulated by creating a workflow that first uses the "Core Techniques" (like file or web retrieval) to gather context and then synthesizing that context into a final answer.

### 2. Agentic Workflows

This approach involves breaking down a complex task and assigning different parts to specialized "agents" or "personas" that can work together.


- **Concept:** For a complex research task, a "Researcher" agent could be responsible for finding information, a "Summarizer" could condense it, a "Critic" could evaluate its quality and relevance, and a "Writer" could assemble the final report.

- **Implementation:** This can be orchestrated by defining different roles and chaining tool calls together. The `SuperGemini` framework with its personas (`--persona-analyzer`, `--persona-scribe`, etc.) is an example of this concept in action.

### 3. Graph-Based Knowledge Representation

This involves extracting entities (like people, products, or concepts) and their relationships from text and storing them in a knowledge graph. This structured format allows for more sophisticated queries and insights.


- **Concept:** Instead of just storing "The `requests` library is used in `auth.py`," you would create two nodes (`requests`, `auth.py`) and a directed edge between them (`is used in`). This allows you to ask complex questions like "What are all the dependencies of `auth.py`?" or "Which files use the `requests` library?".

- **Implementation:** While no tool directly creates a knowledge graph, a workflow can be built to:

  1. Read text from files or web pages.

  2. Parse the text to identify entities and relationships.

  3. Generate a structured representation of this graph (e.g., in JSON format).

  4. Save this structured data to a file for future querying.
