   - Specify if edges have weights
   - Describe node attributes

2. **State your goal clearly**
   - What analysis do you need?
   - What output do you expect?
   - Do you need visualization?

3. **Provide sample data if available**
   - Example nodes and edges
   - Data format (CSV, JSON, etc.)
   - Size of your network

4. **Ask for explanations**
   - Request comments in code
   - Ask about algorithm choices
   - Get complexity analysis

## Example Session

**You:** "Write Python code to create a graph from this edge list and find the most central node:
A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E, E-A, B-D"

**Claude:** [Provides complete Python code with NetworkX]

**You:** "Now add visualization with a circular layout"

**Claude:** [Adds matplotlib visualization code]

**You:** "Explain what betweenness centrality means in this context"

**Claude:** [Explains the concept and its interpretation]

## Installation Requirements

To run the code generated by this skill, you need:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib numpy
```

Optional for advanced features:
```bash
pip install pandas scipy
```

## Skill Capabilities

### Graph Creation
- Create graphs from edge lists
- Import from various file formats
- Generate random graphs
- Build specific topologies

### Analysis Algorithms
- Shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, A*)
- Centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, PageRank)
- Community detection (Louvain, modularity)
- Clustering coefficients
- Connected components
- Minimum spanning trees
- Maximum flow
- Network diameter and radius

### Visualization
- Various layouts (spring, circular, hierarchical, etc.)
- Customized node and edge styling
- Subgraph highlighting
- Interactive plots
- Export to various formats

### Data Processing
- Import from CSV, JSON, GraphML, etc.
- Export to various formats
- Data validation and cleaning
- Graph transformations

## Learning Resources

The skill can also:
- Explain NetworkX concepts
- Suggest appropriate algorithms
- Compare different approaches
- Provide learning resources
- Debug existing code

## Notes

- This is a **coding assistant skill**, not an execution environment
- You'll need to run the generated Python code in your own environment
- Code is optimized for clarity and best practices
- Suitable for both beginners and advanced users

## Getting Started

Just start a conversation with Claude and ask for help with your NetworkX task!

Examples:
- "Help me create a graph analysis script"
- "Show me how to find the shortest path in NetworkX"
- "Write code to detect communities in a social network"
- "How do I visualize a directed graph with NetworkX?"

The skill will guide you through the process and provide clean, working code.
