# Python NetworkX Skill - Prompt Guide

## How to Get the Best Code from Claude

This guide helps you ask effective questions to get high-quality NetworkX Python code.

## Basic Prompt Structure

A good prompt includes:
1. **What you want to do** (the goal)
2. **Your data structure** (nodes, edges, attributes)
3. **Expected output** (analysis, visualization, etc.)
4. **Any constraints** (performance, specific algorithms)

## Prompt Templates

### Template 1: Create a Graph
```
"Write Python code to create a [directed/undirected] graph with:
- Nodes: [list or description]
- Edges: [list or connection rules]
- [Optional] Edge weights: [how weights are determined]
- [Optional] Node attributes: [what attributes nodes have]"
```

**Example:**
```
"Write Python code to create an undirected social network with 20 people,
where each person is randomly connected to 3-5 others."
```

### Template 2: Analyze a Graph
```
"I have a [graph type] with [description of structure].
Please write code to:
- Calculate [specific metric]
- Find [specific pattern]
- Analyze [specific property]"
```

**Example:**
```
"I have a transportation network of 30 cities connected by roads.
Write code to find the 5 most central cities using betweenness centrality
and identify any isolated regions."
```

### Template 3: Load and Process Data
```
"Write code to:
1. Load a graph from [file format: CSV/JSON/etc.]
2. The data has [describe structure]
3. Then [what analysis to perform]
4. Output [what you want to see]"
```

**Example:**
```
"Write code to:
1. Load a graph from a CSV with columns: person1, person2, interaction_count
2. Create a weighted graph where edge weights are interaction counts
3. Find the most influential person using PageRank
4. Save the top 10 people to a new CSV file"
```

### Template 4: Visualization
```
"Create a visualization of [graph description] with:
- Layout: [spring/circular/hierarchical/etc.]
- Highlight: [specific nodes or edges]
- Style: [colors, sizes, labels]
- [Optional] Save as: [file format]"
```

**Example:**
```
"Create a visualization of a citation network with:
- Layout: hierarchical (papers cited at top)
- Node size: proportional to citation count
- Node color: by publication year
- Show edge direction with arrows
- Save as PNG with high resolution"
```

### Template 5: Compare Approaches
```
"Show me [number] different ways to [task] and explain
the pros/cons of each approach."
```

**Example:**
```
"Show me 3 different centrality measures for finding influential nodes
in a social network and explain when to use each one."
```

## Specific Task Prompts

### Shortest Path Problems
```
"Write code to find the shortest path in a weighted graph where:
- Graph structure: [describe]
- Start node: [name]
- End node: [name]
- Weight represents: [distance/cost/time/etc.]
- Handle the case where no path exists"
```

### Community Detection
```
"Write code to detect communities in a social network with [N] nodes.
Use [specific algorithm or 'best algorithm'] and visualize the result
with different colors for each community."
```

### Network Generation
```
"Generate a [type] network with [N] nodes that simulates [scenario].
Include code to verify the network has expected properties like
[specific properties]."
```

### Performance Optimization
```
"Write efficient code to [task] on a large graph with approximately
[number] nodes and [number] edges. Focus on memory efficiency and
speed."
```

### Data Import/Export
```
"Write code to:
1. Import a graph from [format/source]
2. Convert it to [NetworkX format]
3. Validate the data (check for [issues])
4. Export to [format] for use in [tool]"
```

## Advanced Prompts

### Multi-Step Analysis
```
"Create a complete analysis pipeline that:
1. Loads data from [source]
2. Cleans the data by [specific cleaning steps]
3. Creates a [graph type]
4. Calculates [metrics 1, 2, 3]
5. Generates [number] visualizations
6. Exports results to [format]

Include progress messages and error handling."
```

### Custom Algorithm
```
"Implement [specific algorithm or approach] for [task].
The algorithm should:
- Input: [describe input]
- Process: [describe steps]
- Output: [describe output]
- Handle edge cases like [list cases]"
```

### Comparative Analysis
```
"Write code to compare [N] different [graphs/algorithms/approaches]:
- [Option 1 description]
- [Option 2 description]
- [Option 3 description]

Create a summary table showing [metrics to compare]."
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Working with Real Data
```
"I have a CSV file with columns [col1, col2, col3, ...].
Each row represents [what it represents].
Write code to load this data and create a graph where [describe graph structure].
Then analyze [what to analyze]."
```

### Scenario 2: Debugging Help
```
"I have this NetworkX code [paste code] but I'm getting [error/unexpected result].
Can you help me fix it and explain what was wrong?"
```

### Scenario 3: Learning a Concept
```
"Explain [concept] in NetworkX and provide a simple working example
that demonstrates the concept with clear comments."
```

### Scenario 4: Optimization
```
"This code [paste code] works but is slow for large graphs.
Can you optimize it and explain the improvements?"
```

### Scenario 5: Adding Features
```
"I have this working code [paste code].
Can you extend it to also:
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

Keep the existing functionality intact."
```

## Tips for Better Results

### DO:
‚úÖ Be specific about graph properties (directed, weighted, etc.)
‚úÖ Provide example data when possible
‚úÖ Mention the size of your graph (helps with algorithm choice)
‚úÖ State your experience level if you want explanations
‚úÖ Ask for comments in the code
‚úÖ Request error handling
‚úÖ Specify visualization requirements early

### DON'T:
‚ùå Be vague ("make a network")
‚ùå Assume Claude knows your data format
‚ùå Forget to mention performance constraints
‚ùå Skip validation requirements
‚ùå Omit the desired output format

## Example Progression

### Beginner Request:
```
"Show me how to create a simple graph and draw it."
```

### Better Request:
```
"Write Python code to create an undirected graph with 5 nodes (A-E)
and 7 edges connecting them. Then visualize it with node labels."
```

### Best Request:
```
"Write Python code to:
1. Create an undirected graph with nodes: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
2. Add edges: A-B, A-C, B-C, B-D, C-D, C-E, D-E
3. Visualize using spring layout with:
   - Blue nodes (size 1500)
   - Gray edges
   - Bold node labels
   - Figure size 10x8 inches
4. Save as 'graph.png' with 300 DPI
5. Print the number of nodes and edges

Include error handling and comments explaining each step."
```

## Follow-Up Prompts

After getting initial code, you can ask:

- "Add [feature] to this code"
- "Optimize this for graphs with 10,000+ nodes"
- "Explain why you chose [algorithm/approach]"
- "Show an alternative way to do this"
- "Add visualization of [specific aspect]"
- "What are the time and space complexities?"
- "How would this scale to [larger size]?"
- "Add unit tests for this code"

## Domain-Specific Prompts

### Social Networks
```
"Model a social media platform where users can follow others (directed)
and have attributes like follower_count and post_count. Find the top
influencers using appropriate centrality measures."
```

### Biological Networks
```
"Create a protein-protein interaction network from this data [data].
Calculate clustering to identify protein complexes and visualize
the network with proteins colored by their functional category."
```

### Transportation
```
"Build a city transportation network with [N] stops and [M] routes.
Each route has a travel time. Find the optimal route from [start] to [end]
that minimizes total travel time. Show all routes within 10% of optimal."
```

### Supply Chain
```
"Model a supply chain with suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.
Identify bottlenecks using betweenness centrality and suggest alternative
routes if a critical node fails."
```

## Getting Help with Errors

```
"This NetworkX code raises [error type]:
[paste error message]

Here's my code:
[paste code]

What's wrong and how do I fix it?"
```

## Asking for Explanations

```
"Explain this NetworkX code line by line:
[paste code]

I particularly don't understand [specific part]."
```

## Remember

The more context you provide, the better code you'll get!

- Clear goal
- Data structure
- Expected output
- Constraints
- Error handling needs
- Visualization preferences
