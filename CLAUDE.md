## AI Assistant Best Practices

### Tool Selection Strategy

1. **Start with Local Servers** for specific domains:
   - Financial data/trading ‚Üí Trading Server
   - System maintenance ‚Üí Filesystem Server  
   - Weather information ‚Üí Weather Server

2. **Use Third-party Services** for broader capabilities:
   - Documentation needs ‚Üí Context7
   - Web interactions ‚Üí Browser MCP
   - Complex reasoning ‚Üí Sequential Thinking
   - Memory across sessions ‚Üí Memory Server

3. **Combine Tools** for comprehensive solutions:
   - Trading Server + Context7 for investment research
   - Filesystem Server + Memory for system maintenance tracking
   - Weather Server + Browser MCP for location-specific planning

### Error Handling Patterns

All servers implement comprehensive error handling:
- Input validation with clear error messages
- Network timeout protection
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- Dry-run modes for destructive operations

**AI Response Pattern:**
```python
try:
    result = await tool_call(parameters)
    return successful_response(result)
except ValidationError as e:
    return "Please check your input: " + str(e)
except NetworkError as e:
    return "Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."
except Exception as e:
    return "Unexpected error occurred. Please try a different approach."
```

### Safety Considerations

1. **Financial Operations:**
   - Trading server is in paper mode by default
   - Always confirm before suggesting real trading
   - Emphasize educational/simulation context

2. **File Operations:**
   - Filesystem server uses dry-run by default
   - Always preview changes before execution
   - Files go to trash, not permanent deletion

3. **External Services:**
   - Respect API rate limits
   - Handle authentication securely
   - Validate all external data

### Common Usage Workflows

#### Stock Market Analysis Workflow
1. Get current quote for target stocks
2. Fetch historical data for trend analysis
3. Analyze portfolio if positions exist
4. Provide recommendations based on data
5. Offer to place paper trades for learning

#### System Maintenance Workflow
1. Analyze overall disk usage
2. Identify largest files/directories
3. Suggest cleanup operations (dry-run first)
4. Execute approved cleanup operations
5. Verify results and update recommendations

#### Weather Planning Workflow
1. Get current weather conditions
2. Check forecast for planning period
3. Look for weather alerts/warnings
4. Provide planning recommendations
5. Offer to monitor conditions

## Configuration Context

### Environment Setup
- **Trading:** Requires E*TRADE API keys or paper trading mode
- **Weather:** Needs weather API key for data access
- **Third-party:** Various API keys for external services

### File Paths
- All servers use absolute paths in configurations
- UV package manager handles Python dependencies
- NPX handles Node.js based servers

### Testing Approach
- Each server includes CLI testing capabilities
- Comprehensive test suites available
- Dry-run modes for safe testing

## Development Guidance

When helping users extend or modify these servers:

1. **Follow Existing Patterns:**
   - Type hints and input validation
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Dry-run modes for destructive operations
   - Clear documentation and examples

2. **Security First:**
   - Never log sensitive information
   - Validate all inputs thoroughly
   - Use secure communication protocols
   - Implement proper authentication

3. **User Experience:**
   - Provide clear, actionable error messages
   - Include helpful usage examples
   - Implement progress indicators for long operations
   - Offer both CLI and MCP interfaces

## Troubleshooting Context

### Common Issues
1. **Network Connectivity:** Corporate firewalls may block financial APIs
2. **Authentication:** API keys need proper setup in .env files
3. **Dependencies:** UV and NPX need to be properly installed
4. **Permissions:** File operations need appropriate system permissions

### Resolution Strategies
1. **Check Environment:** Verify .env files and API keys
2. **Test Individually:** Use CLI interfaces for direct testing
3. **Validate Setup:** Ensure UV/NPX installations are correct
4. **Check Logs:** Enable debug mode for detailed error information

## AI Assistant Expectations
