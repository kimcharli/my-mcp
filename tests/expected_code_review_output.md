# Expected Code Review Output for Original Issue Scenario

This document shows what the updated `/ck:code-review` command would have produced when reviewing the original ck-apstra-mcp project with the `debug-correct-path.js` files.

## üéØ Overall Assessment
**MAJOR SECURITY ISSUES - REVIEW BLOCKED**

## üìä Review Metrics

- Files Reviewed: 6

- Issues Found: 21 (Critical: 21, High: 0, Low: 0)

- Test Coverage: N/A (blocked by security issues)

- Code Documentation Coverage: N/A (blocked by security issues)

## üî¥ Critical Issues (SECURITY BLOCKERS)
**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY REVIEW STOPPED - MUST FIX BEFORE PROCEEDING**

### Hardcoded Credentials Found

- `debug-correct-path.js:3` - Hardcoded admin password: `const password = "admin"`

- `test-connection.js:4` - Hardcoded admin password: `password: "admin"`

- `test-connection.js:5` - API key exposed: `apiKey: "secret-api-key-12345"`

- `debug-api.js:2` - Production token: `const API_TOKEN = "bearer-token-production"`

- `debug-api.js:3` - Database password: `const DB_PASSWORD = "database-secret-2024"`

- `scratch-test.py:3` - Admin credentials: `admin_pass = "admin"`

### Production Network Information Exposed

- `debug-correct-path.js:4` - Production URL: `https://apstra.46.example.com`

- `debug-correct-path.js:5` - Management IP: `10.0.0.85`

- `debug-correct-path.js:6` - Internal network: `192.168.100.0`

- `test-connection.js:8` - Production server: `https://prod.85.network.com`

- `test-connection.js:9` - Internal IP: `10.1.1.50`

- `debug-api.js:4` - Production host: `https://api.company.46.net`

- `scratch-test.py:4` - Database IP: `192.168.1.100`

## üìÅ Project Structure Issues (CRITICAL)
**ZERO TOLERANCE VIOLATION - Debug files in project root**

### Misplaced Debug/Utility Files

- `debug-correct-path.js` - Debug script in root, contains production credentials

- `test-connection.js` - Test script in root, contains sensitive connection info

- `debug-api.js` - Debug script in root, contains API tokens and production URLs

- `scratch-test.py` - Scratch script in root, contains admin credentials

**Required Action**: Move ALL debug/utility scripts to `scripts/` directory

## ‚úÖ What Would Have Been Flagged
The enhanced security scanning would have immediately detected:


1. **ALL executable files in root** (4 files found and read)

2. **ALL hardcoded credentials** (6 instances across 4 files)

3. **ALL production network references** (7 instances of IPs and URLs)

4. **ALL misplaced debug files** (4 files flagged for relocation)

## üìù Required Actions (Before ANY Other Review)

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Remove all hardcoded credentials from all files

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Remove all production IP addresses and URLs from debug files

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Move debug-correct-path.js to scripts/ directory

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Move test-connection.js to scripts/ directory

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Move debug-api.js to scripts/ directory

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Move scratch-test.py to scripts/ directory

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Use environment variables for all configuration

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add scripts/ directory to .gitignore if it contains sensitive data

- [ ] **SECURITY SCAN**: Re-run security scan after fixes to verify clean state

**‚ö†Ô∏è CODE REVIEW CANNOT PROCEED UNTIL ALL SECURITY ISSUES ARE RESOLVED**

## Comparison: Original vs Enhanced Review

### Original Review (Missed Issues)

- ‚ùå Did not read root executable files

- ‚ùå Only scanned src/ directory for security issues

- ‚ùå Missed hardcoded `admin:admin` credentials

- ‚ùå Missed production `.46` and `.85` URLs

- ‚ùå Missed internal `10.*` and `192.168.*` IPs

- ‚ùå Did not flag misplaced debug files

### Enhanced Review (Catches Everything)

- ‚úÖ Reads ALL executable files in root before any other analysis

- ‚úÖ Scans ENTIRE project for security issues

- ‚úÖ Detects ALL credential patterns including admin:admin

- ‚úÖ Detects ALL production network patterns

- ‚úÖ Flags ALL misplaced debug/utility files in root

- ‚úÖ BLOCKS further review until security issues resolved

**Result**: The original `debug-correct-path.js` issue would have been caught immediately and flagged as SECURITY CRITICAL, preventing the security exposure.
