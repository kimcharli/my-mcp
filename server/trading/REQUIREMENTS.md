# Stock Trading MCP Server Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI models to interact with stock trading platforms like E*TRADE. The server will primarily support paper trading (simulated trading) by default, with the option to execute real trades when explicitly configured to do so.

## System Architecture

The trading system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

### Core Modules

- **trading.py**: Main entry point for the MCP server and tool definitions
- **models.py**: Data structures for positions, orders, accounts, etc.
- **market_data.py**: Market data retrieval (quotes, historical data)
- **paper_trading.py**: Paper trading implementation and simulation
- **utils.py**: Common utility functions
- **cli.py**: Command-line interface for direct interaction

### Planned Extensions

- **brokerages/**: 
  - **\_\_init\_\_.py**: Common interface definition
  - **paper_trading.py**: Paper trading implementation
  - **etrade.py**: E*TRADE API implementation
  - *(Additional brokerages as needed)*
- **analytics.py**: Advanced portfolio analytics
- **visualizations.py**: Data visualization capabilities

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Account Management
- **Authentication**: Securely connect to brokerage APIs (E*TRADE, etc.)
- **Account Information**: Retrieve account balances, positions, and trading history
- **Trading Mode**: Support both paper trading (simulation) and real trading modes
- **Multiple Brokerages**: Extensible design to support multiple brokerages (starting with E*TRADE)

### 2. Market Data
- **Real-time Quotes**: Retrieve current stock prices, bid/ask spreads
- **Historical Data**: Access historical price data and charts
- **Market News**: Get relevant news for specific stocks
- **Option Chains**: Retrieve options data for a given underlying security
- **Watchlists**: Create and manage lists of stocks to monitor

### 3. Order Management
- **Order Types**:
  - Market orders
  - Limit orders
  - Stop orders
  - Stop-limit orders
  - Trailing stop orders
  - Options orders
- **Order Lifecycle**: Create, submit, modify, cancel orders
- **Order Status**: Track order statuses (pending, filled, rejected, etc.)
- **Order Validation**: Validate orders before submission (sufficient funds, valid symbols, etc.)

### 4. Paper Trading
- **Simulated Execution**: Virtual order execution matching real market conditions
- **Virtual Portfolio**: Track virtual positions and performance
- **Historical Backtesting**: Test strategies against historical data
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculate and report key performance metrics

### 5. Risk Management
- **Position Limits**: Enforce maximum position sizes
- **Risk Metrics**: Calculate and report risk metrics (volatility, drawdown, etc.)
- **Loss Prevention**: Implement guardrails to prevent excessive losses
- **Trading Limits**: Enforce daily/weekly trading limits
- **Notifications**: Alert on significant events (large losses, unusual market activities)

### 6. Analysis & Reporting
- **Portfolio Analysis**: Analyze current portfolio composition and risk
- **Performance Reporting**: Generate reports on trading performance
- **Tax Reporting**: Track information needed for tax reporting
- **Trading Journal**: Maintain records of all trades and decisions

### 7. Command Line Interface
- **User-Friendly Commands**: Simple commands for common operations
- **Interactive Mode**: Optional interactive mode for sequential commands
- **Watch Mode**: Real-time monitoring of stocks and portfolio
- **Help System**: Comprehensive help for all commands and options

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Security Requirements
- **API Authentication**: Secure management of API keys and authentication tokens
- **Safe Storage**: Encryption of sensitive data (credentials, account information)
- **Access Controls**: Clear separation between paper trading and real trading modes
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all trading activities

### 2. Implementation Requirements
- **MCP Framework**: Implement using the Model Context Protocol framework
- **Reliability**: Ensure reliable order execution and system stability
- **Extensibility**: Design for easy addition of new brokerages and features
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and reporting
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits for brokerage services

### 3. API Integration
- **E*TRADE API**: Integration with E*TRADE API (primary)
- **Webhook Support**: Support for webhook callbacks for order status updates
- **Common Interface**: Abstract common operations across different brokerages

### 4. Configuration
- **Environment-based**: Configuration via environment variables
- **Profile-based**: Support for multiple trading profiles
- **Risk Parameters**: Configurable risk management parameters
- **Default Safety**: Conservative defaults to prevent accidental live trading

## Dependencies
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `mcp`: For Model Context Protocol implementation
  - `httpx`: For API communications
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations
  - `python-dotenv`: For environment variable management
  - `pydantic`: For data validation and settings management
  - Brokerage-specific SDKs (e.g., `pyetrade` for E*TRADE)

### Build Tool Requirements
- **UV Package Manager**:
  - Version: 0.5.24 or higher
  - Required for dependency management and script execution
  - Configuration files:
    - `requirements.in`: Primary requirements
    - `requirements.dev.in`: Development requirements
    - `requirements.test.in`: Testing requirements


## Modular Design
The system follows these design principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - Each module has a single responsibility
   - Clear interfaces between modules
   - Minimal coupling between components

2. **Extensibility**:
   - Abstract interfaces for broker implementations
   - Plugin architecture for data sources
   - Configuration-driven behavior

3. **Testability**:
   - Each module can be tested independently
   - Mock implementations for external dependencies
   - Clear separation of business logic from external APIs

## Safety Considerations
- Paper trading mode must be the default
- Clear separation and warnings when switching to real trading
- Confirmation steps for critical operations in real trading mode
- Automatic failsafes to prevent significant losses
- Circuit breakers for unusual market conditions or system issues
- Comprehensive validation before order submission

## Success Criteria
- Successful authentication with E*TRADE API
- Accurate market data retrieval and display
- Functional paper trading with realistic execution simulation
- Proper order submission, tracking, and management
- Accurate portfolio and performance tracking
- Clear distinction between paper and real trading modes
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback


## Development Environment

### UV Configuration
The project uses uv for dependency management with the following structure:

1. **Requirements Files**:
   - `requirements.in`: Primary project dependencies
   - `requirements.dev.in`: Development tools and utilities
   - `requirements.test.in`: Testing frameworks and tools

2. **Generated Files**:
   - `requirements.txt`: Locked production dependencies
   - `requirements.dev.txt`: Locked development dependencies
   - `requirements.test.txt`: Locked test dependencies

3. **UV Settings**:
   - Custom cache directory: `.cache/uv`
   - Default index: PyPI
   - Virtual environment: `.venv`
